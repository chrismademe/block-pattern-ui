A simple UI for creating and managing Block Patterns

== Description ==

Block Patterns are great, but registering them can be a little tedious. This plugin fixes that by allowing you to create and register Block Patterns using the Block Editor itself! You simply add the blocks you want to use as a pattern, add some (optional) information about them and you're ready to start using them in your posts and pages.
